## Work Division

### Backend Team Tasks
1. Database schema design and implementation
2. Customer API endpoints implementation
3. Order API endpoints implementation
4. Employee API endpoints implementation
5. Image storage service integration
6. API documentation
7. Authentication/authorization implementation

### Frontend Team Tasks
1. Project setup and routing implementation
2. Shared components development
3. Dashboard view implementation
4. Orders management views
5. Customer management views
6. Employee management views
7. Image handling components
8. State management setup

## Additional Considerations

### Authentication/Authorization
* Role-based access control (admin vs employee)
* JWT token-based authentication

### Image Handling
* Image compression before upload
* Thumbnail generation
* Secure image storage

### Data Validation
* Phone number format validation
* Required fields validation
* Order status transitions validation

### Error Handling
* Consistent error response format
* Frontend error display components
* Network error handling

### Search/Filter Capabilities
* Server-side pagination
* Multiple filter combinations
* Efficient search implementations

This structure allows both teams to work independently while maintaining clear integration points. The backend team can start with database design and core APIs while the frontend team begins with component structure and routing setup.
